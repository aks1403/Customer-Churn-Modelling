# Churn Analysis of an Internet & Telephone Provider

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for an Internet and Telephone Provider. The project integrates Cohort Analysis and Predictive Modeling to develop a robust model for identifying customers at risk of churning. The aim is to provide actionable insights for implementing proactive customer retention strategies.

## Key Features
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of key variables.
- Visualized trends and patterns in customer behavior over time.

### 2. Cohort Analysis
- Conducted cohort analysis to segment customers based on their signup date.
- Analyzed customer retention and churn patterns within cohorts.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Utilized ordinal encoding for categorical variables, one-hot encoding for nominal variables, and imputation for missing data.
- Implemented a pipeline and column transformer for efficient data preprocessing.

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- Employed a variety of machine learning models for predictive analysis:
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - AdaBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Employed cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.
